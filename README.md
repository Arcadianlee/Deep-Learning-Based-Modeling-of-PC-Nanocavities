# Deep-Learning-Based-Modeling-of-PC-Nanocavities
Modeling and designing Photonic Crystal Nanocavities via Deep Learning.
Uploaded files are the dataset, computer code, and supplementary materials for our paper. 
Software information: Python IDE PyCharm and MATLAB were used to generated the graphs with data. Adobe Illustrator was used to create and post-process the pictorial illustrations and schematics. Python and MATLAB were used for data modeling and machine learning. Pytorch was the libaray we stuck with. Physical simulations were run on two HP workstations with 8 CPUs and 2 GPUs each. Machine learning was run on my macbook.
